          <p class="description-text">This was a project I worked on with a team for Lexata, Inc. during the winter of 2022.<br><br> We engineered a ground-breaking search tool for legal rules to accelerate search processes for legal teams. By taking advantage of OpenAI's GPT-3 semantic search engine, our tool could quickly and accurately return sections of legal documents corresponding to a user's search queries, without them having to dig through pages of legal documents.<br><br> One of my achievements from this project was devising an efficient database organization and back-end design that improved both the ease of development for our team and the flexibility for future expansions. Furthermore, through working on this project, I have gotten experience working with multiple areas of the software stack, such as the backend API and the CI/CD system.<br><br> The code for this project is not available publicly, but can be discussed further upon request.</p>

          <p class="description-text">This was an individual project I completed during the fall of 2021 for the CSC309 web development course at U of T.<br><br> Simple Map Diagrams is a front-end JavaScript library that aims to streamline the creation of interactive mini-maps for web apps. Its main purpose is to allow developers to create very specific and customizable interactive mini-maps for their web apps. This project combined several of my personal interests, from software development to geography and mapping.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/williamwang256/simple-map-diagrams">Source code</a><br><br><a href="https://fierce-shelf-08886.herokuapp.com/index.html">Demo page</a></p>
