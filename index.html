My current assignment is as a Quality Engineer with the General Insurance Statistical Agency (GISA), where we are implementing a frontend web portal as well as the backend database as a part of IBM's role as GISA's Statistical Service Provider. My contributions include:
              <ul>
                <li>Supporting the frontend (web portal), backend (database), PowerBI, and Exhibit generation teams</li>
                <li>Verifying application compliance with web standards for accessibility.</li>
                <li>Conducting automated scans and testing of web page and source code to detect and report defects related to accessibility, usability, and functionality, providing detailed descriptions and proposed remediation plans to the development team.</li>
                <li>Automating the upload of data files to a SQL database using Python, leveraging API features to reduce upload times from days to hours.</li>
                <li>Automating the execution of regression tests using IBM's IGNITE OTFA tool.</li>

            <p><em>May 2022 - September 2023</em></p>
            <p>
              Between my third and fourth years of my undergraduate degree, I completed a 16-month internship at Intel with the Programmable Solutions Group. 
              During my time there as a software applications engineer, I supported Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/dpc-compiler.html#gs.5gu3zx">oneAPI DPC++ (Data Parallel C++) compiler</a> for FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), through which I learned a lot about computer system architectures and gained invaluable experience writing and communicating clean and performant code. My work ranged from supporting customers to creating reference designs and tutorials for Intel's <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples">oneAPI code samples repository</a>. I cooperated with compiler teams in designing and optimizing complex, high-performance algorithms in C++, while also leveraging my skills gained from developing libraries, tutorials, and reference designs to work in close liaison with clients. Some of my proudest accomplishments include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designing and publishing a <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/C%2B%2BSYCL_FPGA/ReferenceDesigns/matmul">systolic-array matrix multiplication library</a> using C++, which delivers a practical and reusable high-performance solution to a frequently employed operation in math, science, and AI.</li>
              <li>Presenting code enhancements that streamlined user experience and decreased run time by up to 70%.</li>
              <li>Finding and reporting critical issues to advance the quality and usability of the product.</li>
              <li>Leading meetings with colleagues across the company to showcase product capabilities and gather feedback to drive product focus.</li>

            <p>
              During the summer of 2020, I joined Ciena Corporation as an intern with the Packet Control Plane team. I designed, implemented, and maintained code for an elaborate test automation framework in Python. One of my accomplishments was expanding the reporting of test case failures by getting additional information from test logs and displaying it using clear and easy-to-read tables in automatic email reports. A unique project I worked on involved producing short tutorial videos to document and showcase features in a creative and engaging way to promote our team's work to others in the organization.

          <h4>Systolic-Array Matrix Multiplication Library</h4>
          <p><em>May 2022 - September 2023</em></p>
          <p>
            During my internship at Intel, I designed, optimized, and built a matrix multiplication code sample that serves as both a reusable library and a reference implementation for linear algebra workloads. Throughout development, I collaborated with compiler engineering teams to integrate advanced compiler features and maximize performance. I had the opportunity to present this work at an internal symposium, showcasing both the design and our broader tooling to a technical audience. This project strengthened my ability to write and document efficient, readable code, manage a self-directed technical initiative, and seek out feedback to refine my approach. The final design is now published in Intel's open-source <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/C%2B%2BSYCL_FPGA/ReferenceDesigns/matmul">oneAPI-samples repository</a>.

          <h4>AI-Powered Legal Search Tool</h4>
          <p><em>January 2022 - April 2022</em></p>
          <p>
            During the winter of 2022, I collaborated with a team at Lexata, Inc. to develop an innovative search tool that streamlines legal rule discovery for legal teams. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3 semantic search capabilities, our solution enables users to retrieve relevant sections of legal documents with precision, eliminating the need to manually sift through extensive texts. My contributions included designing a flexible database architecture and backend system that enhanced both development efficiency and scalability. I also gained hands-on experience across the software stack, including backend API development and CI/CD integration. This project deepened my understanding of full-stack engineering and reinforced the value of thoughtful system design in accelerating team productivity. Note: The code for this project is not publicly available but can be discussed further upon request.

          <h4>Simple Map Diagrams - Front-End Library</h4>
          <p><em>May 2020 - August 2020</em></p>
          <p>
            Simple Map Diagrams is a front-end JavaScript library I developed as an individual project for the CSC309 “Programming on the Web” course at the University of Toronto. Designed to simplify the creation of interactive mini-maps for web applications, the library enables developers to build highly customizable and purpose-specific map components with ease. This project brought together several of my personal interests, including software development, geography, and mapping—into a cohesive and practical tool for the web. <a href="https://github.com/williamwang256/simple-map-diagrams-SMD">Source code</a> and <a href="https://williamwang256.github.io/simple-map-diagrams-SMD/">live demo page</a>.
