          <h4>Software Engineering Intern, Intel Corporation</h4>
          <p style="color: #888888">May 2022 – present | Toronto, Ontario</p>
          <p class="description-text">I am currently working as a software engineer intern supporting Intel’s oneAPI compiler for FPGAs. In the time I have spent in this position so far, I have gotten the opportunity to work with several aspects of the product. For example, I work closely with the compiler itself on a daily basis through designing and optimizing complex algorithms in C++. One of my main projects involved building a systolic matrix multiplication library using C++, which provided a practical and reusable high-performance solution to a very frequently employed operation. Meanwhile, I have also been leveraging my knowledge of the compiler gained from developing libraries, tutorials, and reference designs to support customers and present feedback to engineering teams.</p>

          <h4>Software Engineering Intern, Ciena Canada Inc.</h4>
          <p style="color: #888888">May – August 2020 | Ottawa, Ontario</p>
          <p class="description-text">During the summer of 2020, I worked as an intern at Ciena with the Packet Control Plane team. I worked on designing, implementing, and maintaining code for a test automation framework in Python. One of my accomplishments included expanding the reporting of test case failures by getting additional information from test logs and displaying it using clear and easy-to-read tables in automatic email reports. A unique project I worked on involved producing short tutorial videos to document features in a new and engaging way to promote our team's work to others in the organization.</p>
